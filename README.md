Current Flow

Customer fills out the booking form → message sent to admin via Telegram.

Admin now has all booking details: name, contact, date, pickup, destination, passengers, requests.

Recommended Steps
Step 1: Confirm Receipt of Booking

Send a confirmation email (or Telegram message) to the customer:

Let them know you received the booking request.

Optionally, restate key booking details so they can double-check.

Example subject: "Your Shuttle Booking Request is Received"

Example content:

Hi Tamiru,

Thank you for your booking request! Here are the details we received:

Pickup: Seattle Airport
Destination: Seattle Downtown
Date: 2025-12-11
Time: 11:08 PM
Passengers: 2
Special Requests: Extra stop at hotel

We will calculate your price and send you the payment instructions shortly.

Step 2: Calculate Price & Send Payment Details

Admin calculates the total fare (based on distance, passengers, special requests, etc.).

Send an invoice or payment request via email or a secure payment platform.

Include:

Total price

Accepted payment methods

Reference number (optional)

Step 3: Receive Payment

Customer sends payment through the agreed method.

Admin verifies the payment.

Step 4: Send Receipt / Final Confirmation

After receiving payment:

Send a receipt with payment confirmation.

Include any final instructions, e.g., where exactly the shuttle will pick them up.

Optional Improvements

Automate Step 1: You can set up an automatic email response after form submission.

Use a Booking System: Telegram is simple, but a small web-based booking system could track payments automatically.

Include Payment Link: If possible, include a secure payment link in the confirmation email to speed up the process.

Keep Communication Organized: Consider tagging bookings with “Pending Payment” or “Confirmed” status.


##Revised Main steps
Your current method works fine for small operations, but for better professionalism and safety:

Confirm booking via email immediately.

Calculate price and send payment instructions.

Receive payment and send a receipt.

This flow is standard for most shuttle or transport booking services.
